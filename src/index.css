@import "tailwindcss";
/* ``` */

/* ### 4. Remove `tailwind.config.js` (Optional but Recommended)
In Tailwind v4, configuration is moving toward CSS-first. You can actually **delete** your `tailwind.config.js` file and put your configurations directly in your CSS file using the `@theme` block.

**Example of v4 configuration in `index.css`:**
```css */
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  --font-sans: "Inter", ui-sans-serif, system-ui;
  --color-brand: #3b82f6;
}
/* ``` */
/* 
### Why did this happen?
You installed the latest version (v4). The old way of using `tailwindcss` in `postcss.config.js` is no longer supported because the engine has been completely rewritten for better performance. Following the steps above aligns your project with the new v4 standards. */
